title: Not Dead Yet

I haven’t updated this blog in an embarrassingly long time, but I can put the blame on Typo and/or DreamHost: posting an article would consistently and silently fail. Meh.

So I’m experimenting with [Mephisto](http://mephistoblog.com/) instead, and while it doesn’t seem to some of the nice sidebar features, it does at least work, and was fairly easy to setup. Hopefully now I’ll actually be able to get some content up here.
