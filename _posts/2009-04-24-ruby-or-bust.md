title: Ruby or Bust!

… or, er, Something Else!

If you haven’t noticed the trend, the fact that I’m updating this blog means I’m once again between jobs. I’ve decided that I’m getting sick of C/C<span class="underline"></span>, and really need a daily dose of sweet, sweet Ruby Goodness. To that end, I’m on the hunt for what will probably end up being a Rails gig, preferably closer to home than downtown Seattle.

So in between job googling, I’m polishing my Rails skills a little and catching up on (two years of) the [Ruby on Rails Podcast](http://podcast.rubyonrails.org/) .
