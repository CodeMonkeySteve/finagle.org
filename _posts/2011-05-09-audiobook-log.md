For over a year I’ve been commuting for almost 2 hours a day, and in an attempt to stave-off potentially lethal boredom, I’ve been passing the time listening to audiobooks. Here’s what I’ve been reading/listening
to:

While all of the books were good, the quality of the audiobook depends almost entirely on the voice of the person reading it. So far my favorites are [Tom Weiner’s](http://www.audiofilemagazine.com/gvpages/A2427.shtml) rich baritone and [Richard Dawkins’](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins) pleasant english accent. By far the worst, though, is anything read by Carl Sagan: I can highly recommend Carl’s plodding pace and odd word emphasis to insomniacs who don’t respond to strong drugs.
